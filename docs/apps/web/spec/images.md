# web — images and `next/image`

**Back:** [web overview](overview.md) · **Related:** [web conventions](web-conventions.md), [architecture](architecture.md)

Normative rules for raster images in `apps/web`: when to use Next.js [`Image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), how to configure remotes, and what to avoid.

## Purpose

- **Performance:** responsive `srcset`, modern formats (WebP/AVIF where supported), lazy loading, and stable layout (CLS).
- **Consistency:** one pattern for user-facing photos (avatars, feed media, covers) and a different pattern for icons and rich text.

## Decision table

| Category | Use | Rationale |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| Feed thumbnails / post preview images | `next/image` (often `fill` in a sized container) | Largest visual payload; UGC aspect ratios vary — container defines layout |
| Avatars (user, tagged objects) | `next/image` with explicit `width` / `height` and `sizes` | Fixed display size; many instances per view |
| Profile / hero cover images | `next/image` with `fill`, `priority`, `sizes` | Above-the-fold; avoid delaying LCP |
| Small UI (icons, decorative graphics) | Inline SVG or static `<img>` | `Image` adds little value; SVG scales cleanly |
| Markdown or rich HTML body images (future) | Plain `<img>` with `loading="lazy"` | Arbitrary URLs and dimensions; integrating `Image` in markdown renderers is high cost |

## Configuration (`next.config.js`)

- **`images.remotePatterns`** — allowlisted hosts for the default image optimizer. The app loads **UGC** from many domains (thumbnails, covers, custom avatars). The config includes known CDNs and broad **HTTPS** and **HTTP** patterns (`hostname: '**'`) so arbitrary public hosts work, including legacy **`http://`** URLs (e.g. older imgur links).
- **`images.minimumCacheTTL`** — set to **86400** (24h) to reduce repeated optimization work for stable UGC URLs.
- **Adding hosts:** prefer documenting new first-party or CDN hosts in this file when they become common; the broad pattern is a pragmatic default, not a security boundary for private data.

**Future:** if traffic or abuse becomes an issue, move to an **image proxy** (validate URL, cache at the edge) and tighten `remotePatterns` to that proxy plus static CDNs.

## `sizes` and layout

- **Fixed-size avatars:** `sizes={`${size}px`}` or `sizes="36px"` when width/height match the rendered box.
- **Feed preview:** responsive `sizes` reflecting the feed column (e.g. `(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw`). Adjust if layout breakpoints change.
- **Cover / hero:** `sizes="100vw"` when the image spans the viewport width of its region.

Use **`fill`** when the visual box is defined by a parent (`relative` + height/aspect); use **explicit `width` / `height`** when the asset renders at a fixed pixel size.

- **Flex parents:** In a row flex, default `align-items: stretch` can stretch a fixed-size avatar vertically. `UserAvatar` uses **`self-start`**, **`shrink-0`**, and inline **`width` / `height` / `minWidth` / `minHeight`** so the box stays square (same idea as a plain `<img>` with explicit pixel dimensions).

## `priority`

- Use **`priority`** only for **above-the-fold** images that matter for LCP (e.g. profile cover on the profile page).
- Do **not** set `priority` on every feed row — that disables lazy loading and hurts performance.

## Fallback and errors

- For components that swap to a placeholder when loading fails (e.g. `UserAvatar`), keep **`onError`** + React state: on error, render the placeholder `Image` (or branch) instead of the remote URL.
- Some hosts (e.g. **`img.3speakcontent.co`**) can fail the optimizer’s **server-side** `fetch` (DNS / network). Use **`shouldUnoptimizeRemoteImage(src)`** from `@/shared/presentation` and pass **`unoptimized`** to `Image` for those URLs so the browser loads the asset directly; pair with **`onError`** where a visible fallback is needed (e.g. feed preview media).

## Markdown content

When post bodies are rendered as Markdown/HTML, use normal **`<img>`** tags with **`loading="lazy"`** unless there is a dedicated pipeline that supplies dimensions and a single remote policy. Do not block Markdown on the default image optimizer.

## Verification

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pnpm nx lint web` | ESLint |
| `pnpm nx build web` | Ensures `Image` src domains match `remotePatterns` |
